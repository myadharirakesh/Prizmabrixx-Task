                <h4>The words nature and natural are used for all the things that are normally not made by humans. The word comes from the Latin natura meaning "birth". Nature includes many things like weather, organisms, 
                    landforms, celestial bodies. Scientists study the way the parts of nature work. 
                    Things that have been made by people are said to be man-made or called artifacts.Environmental content is about integrating green issues, educating, and explaining green 
                    problems and outcomes so target audiences can walk away with knowledge on a particular green topic.
                    Types of Ecosystem
                    There are two main types of ecosystems. Listed below are the types and examples of the ecosystem.
                    
                    Natural ecosystem – It is a naturally produced biological environment found in nature. It includes deserts, forests, grasslands, lakes, mountains, ponds, rivers, oceans, etc.
                    Artificial ecosystem – It is an artificial environment which is created and maintained by man. It includes an aquarium, crop fields, gardens, parks, zoo, etc.
                    The components of the environment are mainly divided into two categories.
